# Simple C++ library for geodesic and trigonometric calculations

[Erkir (armenian: Երկիր)](https://github.com/vahancho/erkir) - is inspired by and based on the great work of [Chris Veness](https://github.com/chrisveness), the owner of the [Geodesy functions](https://github.com/chrisveness/geodesy) project - provides a set of comprehensive API for geodesic and trigonometric calculations. I would call it a C++ port of JavaScript functions provided by the mentioned Chris Veness' project, however I designed the library to be more object oriented. Thus the code is organized a little bit differently, but the implementation itself is preserved.
